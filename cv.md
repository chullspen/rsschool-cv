My goal is to get **competent** in Web-development. Another goal of major importance for me is to be able to use my creativity and strong will to find solutions to create impressive web sites and applications. I have always been mesmerized by the **potential of the technologies** around me and one day I just tought to myself that it would have been nice to be able to use this potential for the good (to automate some borring stuff and to make sure people can easily reach some useful information)

I want to enlarge my knowledge of **JS and its frameworks**. Moreover, I think that one of my strongest points is **communication** with people. So I would not only be able to work on my own but work efficiently in a team too.
I'm a hard-working man and I can learn fast. More than that I dedicate a lot of my free time to self-education. I'm simply used to that.

### Skills:
- Python 
- PyQt5 (a framework for creating GUIs in Python)
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- JQuery

### Experience
Currently I'm working as an English tutor and a freelancer. I'm creating a web site which would contain an interractive test to raise the awarness for the Holocaust in Belarus during the times of the Great Patriotic war. I'm using the default web-kit for this (HTML, CSS, JS) and JQuery. I'm planning to finish my project in the middle of September.
Sorry, I wouldn't post the source code of it untill the project is finished.
In addition to that I was working on a GUI for the same project using Python and its framework called PyQt5. 
As a funny experiment I have a created a Telegram bot for my friend using Python.


### Education 
- MSLU (bachelor's degree)
- Brad Traversy's HTML/CSS and JS courses on Udemy
- A ton of development-related videos on youtube 
- A book called "Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke
- A book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart

### English 
I have worked as an English teacher for 2 years already (on my own and for a company). I have taught many different levels of English, including Upper-Intermediate level. 
But my development in English doesn't only stop there. I read a lot and I like watching all sorts of educative content on the Internet.
